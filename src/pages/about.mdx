# About Hwangstice

### Where the cold lingers, so does curiosity. ❄️

I'm **Dat Hwang**, aka **hwangstice**. I'm just a noob who obsesses over **David Goggins**. In my personal view, the words and actions of David Goggins are like not motivators, but my life.

This space is a frozen archive of my thoughts and of the experiments and challenges I've made on **Reverse Engineering** and **Pwnable**.

Break things to understand, understand to rebuild.

Stay hard.

— Dat Hwang
