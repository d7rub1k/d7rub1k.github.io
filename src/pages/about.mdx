# About Hwangstice

---

### Where the cold lingers, so does curiosity. ❄️

I'm **Dat Hwang**, aka **hwangstice** — a disciple of **David Goggins'** relentless mindset. His words aren't just motivation; they're a way of life.

This space is a frozen archive of my thoughts, experiments, and challenges in **Reverse Engineering** and **Pwnable**.

Breaking things to understand. Understanding to rebuild. Pushing limits because there are none.

Stay hard. Always learning. Always improving.

— Dat Hwang
