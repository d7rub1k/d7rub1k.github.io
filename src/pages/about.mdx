# About Hwangstice

---

### Where the cold lingers, so does curiosity. ❄️

I'm **Dat Hwang**, or **Hwangstice** - chasing the unkown in **Reverse Engineering**.

This space is a frozen archive of thoughts, experiments, and challenges.

Breaking things to understand. Understanding to rebuild.

Always learning, always improving.

— Dat Hwang
